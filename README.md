# Mental Health Model: EDA and LightGBM

This repository contains a project focused on predicting mental health outcomes using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and LightGBM machine learning models.

## Project Overview
- **EDA**: Understanding the data and visualizing patterns.
- **Modeling**: Training a LightGBM model to predict mental health outcomes.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with appropriate metrics.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the project.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing, EDA, and modeling.
- `models/`: Saved models for reuse.
- `outputs/`: Generated figures and evaluation reports.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-model.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks or scripts.

## Dependencies
